## Installation & Running Locally
1) Create `.env.local` in project root (example):
   DB_HOST=localhost  
   DB_USER=root  
   DB_PASSWORD=yourpassword  
   DB_NAME=schooldb  

2) Install dependencies:
   npm install

3) Start the dev server:
   npm run dev

## Database Auto-Creation
On first request to the API, the app will:
- Create the database `schooldb` if missing
- Create the `schools` table if missing
- Ensure `public/schoolImages/` exists for uploads
- Insert dummy school data (with real images) only if the table is empty

## Vercel Deployment (Important)
- This project uses a local MySQL database and local image storage, as required in the assignment.  
- These features do not work on Vercel because:
  - Vercel is a stateless serverless host (no persistent MySQL or filesystem)
  - Local image uploads and DB operations are not supported  
- Therefore:
  - The app may deploy on Vercel but show errors or empty data  
  - To see full functionality, run locally with MySQL using the steps above
